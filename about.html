  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hello! I'm Fatima Yousofi — a data and research analyst with experience at the IFC and World Bank Group. I’m currently pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics at Georgetown University, where I focus on applying data science and machine learning to real-world economic and operational problems.</p>

  <p>My work spans macroeconomic research, spatial modeling, and customer analytics — using Python, R, and SQL. I lead technical analysis on climate and infrastructure risk, employee retention, and pricing strategy across projects in development, finance, and marketing.</p>

  <p>What drives me is solving real-world problems with data. Whether that means identifying flood risk zones in Peru or optimizing resource allocation through predictive modeling — I aim to produce insights that matter.</p>
